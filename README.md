# DivaSlide
The goal of this project is to be an open source touch slider for Project DIVA Future Tone (PS4) controllers. Currenty no official solution exists for emulating the touch slider on the arcade cabinet in an at hone use case.


This project is based on the NXP semiconductors MPR121 capacitive touch sensor and the ATMEGA328 series of microprocessors. The hardware design is open source and will be updated as I progress further.

Current functionality:
up to four (4) MPR121 IC's can be interpreted for a 48 part touch slider
Outputs single left, single right, double left, double right, and single opposing slides

To be added:
LED finger tracking with the WS281 LED
